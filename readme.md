Assignment -4: The Lost Toll 


Our team created 2 visualizations:
1. Geo-spatial Visualization using Scatter MapBox in Plotly. 
The code for this visual is in jupyter notebook 'Visualization1-Geospatial visual.ipynb'
The folder even_new contains the images/plots formed by this notebook.
Using these plots from different timestamps, we create a GIF for presentation purpose.


2. Line Plots for visualing the state of Karnataka.
The code for this visual is in jupyter notebook 'Visualization2-State Level Understanding.ipynb'

We have a dash app created for sharing the presentation to a wider audience. The code for the same is present in the 'dash app' folder.
